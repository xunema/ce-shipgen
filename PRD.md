## 11. ADDENDUM — March 2, 2026 (Session 3 Requirements)

### 11.1 PWA Install Prompt & Install-State Indicator (FR-021)

**Priority:** High
**Trigger:** User confirmed all 13 data tables are now editable and functional. Next priority is guiding users to install the app locally so they have a personal working copy.

**Problem Statement:**
Users visiting the web version have no clear signal that the app can be saved to their desktop/home screen, nor any indication of which mode they are currently running in (web vs. installed PWA). Without this, users may not realise they can work offline with their own customised tables.

**Requirements:**

**FR-021a: Install Prompt**
- Detect PWA installability via the `beforeinstallprompt` event (Chrome/Edge/Android)
- On the Startup screen, show a prominent "Install App" button or banner when the app is installable
- On iOS (Safari), show a manual instruction overlay: "Tap Share → Add to Home Screen"
- After install, suppress the prompt (do not show again)
- Store `install_prompted` flag in localStorage

**FR-021b: Running-Mode Indicator**
- Detect installed/standalone mode via:
  - `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches`
  - `window.navigator.standalone === true` (iOS fallback)
- When running in **standalone (installed) mode**: show a persistent badge in the app header — e.g., a green dot or "Installed" chip — so users know they are on their local copy
- When running in **web/browser mode**: show a subtle "Install for offline use" link in the header or footer
- The indicator must be visible from all screens (Design, Library, Settings)

**FR-021c: Offline Status**
- Display a status indicator when the device is offline (use `navigator.onLine` + `online`/`offline` events)
- Offline: amber indicator "Offline — using local data"
- Online: no indicator (default state)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Install button appears on Startup screen when browser supports install
- [ ] iOS users see manual install instructions
- [ ] Header shows "Installed" badge when in standalone mode
- [ ] Offline indicator appears/disappears correctly
- [ ] No install prompt shown if already installed

---

### 11.2 Auto-Save & Settings Workflow (FR-022) — Revised

**Priority:** High
**Revised:** March 2, 2026 (Session 4) — original export/import concept superseded by Settings Snapshots (FR-024)

**Core Principle:**
The app always auto-saves. There is no "Save" button for table edits. The user's working state is always current. The canonical `public/data/*.json` files are read-only factory defaults — they are never modified. The user's personal layer lives entirely in localStorage on top of those defaults.

**Data Architecture:**

| Layer | Storage | Contains | User action to reset |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Factory defaults | `public/data/*.json` (shipped) | Canonical rule tables | N/A — read-only |
| Live working state | `localStorage` (`ce_shipgen_live_*`) | Current tables + rules, always current | "Reset to Defaults" |
| Named snapshots | `localStorage` (`ce_shipgen_presets`) | Array of saved settings states | Delete snapshot |
| Ship library | `localStorage` / IndexedDB | Saved ship designs | Never auto-reset |

**FR-022a: Auto-Save on Edit**
- Table view: save to localStorage on every cell commit (blur or Enter key) — no Save button
- JSON view: keep an explicit "Apply" button — needed because mid-edit JSON is invalid and cannot be auto-saved keystroke-by-keystroke
- Show a brief "Saved" toast (1.5s) after each auto-save so the user has confirmation
- No "unsaved changes" state in table view — every committed edit is immediately persisted

**FR-022b: Reset Live State to Factory Defaults**
- In Settings → Data Management: "Reset All to Defaults" button
- Clears all `ce_shipgen_live_*` keys and `ce_shipgen_rules` from localStorage
- **Never touches ship library data**
- Confirmation dialog: "Reset all tables and rules to the original web defaults? Your saved ships will not be affected."
- Label: "Reset to Web Defaults" — not "Reset to Blank" (blank = broken, defaults = known-good)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Table edits auto-save on cell commit with "Saved" toast
- [ ] JSON view retains explicit "Apply" button
- [ ] "Reset to Web Defaults" clears only settings, not ship library
- [ ] No "Save" button visible in table edit mode

---

### 11.3 Input Security — Editable Tables (FR-023)

**Priority:** High
**Trigger:** When the app is made public, malicious actors may attempt to inject harmful content via the editable table fields. The following requirements govern how user-supplied data is handled.

**Threat Model:**

| Threat | Vector | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Stored XSS | Inject `<script>` or event handlers into table string fields | Low (mitigated by React) | React renders text nodes, not HTML, so `String(value)` in JSX is safe |
| HTML injection via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | Any future use of `innerHTML` with table data | **High if introduced** | Currently not used — must never be introduced with table data |
| Prototype pollution via JSON.parse | `{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}` in imported JSON | Low (modern JS engines block this) | Use `Object.create(null)` pattern for sensitive parsing |
| Schema confusion / type mismatch | String in numeric field causes NaN in calculations | Medium | Currently no schema validation — calculation engine will inherit garbage |
| Malicious JSON import shared between users | User A crafts a JSON file, shares with User B who imports it | Medium | Content is rendered safely by React, but could break calculations |
| localStorage tampering (browser console) | User directly edits localStorage keys | Low (self-inflicted) | Out of scope — local storage is the user's own environment |

**Current Safety Status:**
- ✅ React JSX text rendering is XSS-safe by default — `{String(value)}` produces text nodes
- ✅ `title={String(value)}` attribute values are escaped by React
- ✅ No `eval()`, `Function()`, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` used with table data
- ⚠️ No schema validation on import — invalid types reach the calculation engine
- ⚠️ No string sanitization — HTML tags in fields are harmless now but risky if future code ever uses innerHTML
- ⚠️ No max-length enforcement on string fields

**Requirements:**

**FR-023a: Schema Validation on Import**
- When importing a JSON table, validate each row against the expected schema for that table

---

### 11.3 Input Security — Editable Tables (FR-023)

**Priority:** High
**Trigger:** When the app is made public, malicious actors may attempt to inject harmful content via the editable table fields. The following requirements govern how user-supplied data is handled.

**Threat Model:**

| Threat | Vector | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Stored XSS | Inject `<script>` or event handlers into table string fields | Low (mitigated by React) | React renders text nodes, not HTML, so `String(value)` in JSX is safe |
| HTML injection via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | Any future use of `innerHTML` with table data | **High if introduced** | Currently not used — must never be introduced with table data |
| Prototype pollution via JSON.parse | `{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}` in imported JSON | Low (modern JS engines block this) | Use `Object.create(null)` pattern for sensitive parsing |
| Schema confusion / type mismatch | String in numeric field causes NaN in calculations | Medium | Currently no schema validation — calculation engine will inherit garbage |
| Malicious JSON import shared between users | User A crafts a JSON file, shares with User B who imports it | Medium | Content is rendered safely by React, but could break calculations |
| localStorage tampering (browser console) | User directly edits localStorage keys | Low (self-inflicted) | Out of scope — local storage is the user's own environment |

**Current Safety Status:**
- ✅ React JSX text rendering is XSS-safe by default — `{String(value)}` produces text nodes
- ✅ `title={String(value)}` attribute values are escaped by React
- ✅ No `eval()`, `Function()`, or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` used with table data
- ⚠️ No schema validation on import — invalid types reach the calculation engine
- ⚠️ No string sanitization — HTML tags in fields are harmless now but risky if future code ever uses innerHTML
- ⚠️ No max-length enforcement on string fields

**Requirements:**

**FR-023a: Schema Validation on Import**
- When importing a JSON table, validate each row against the expected schema for that table
- Check: required fields present, numeric fields are numbers, string fields are strings
- Reject import if >10% of rows fail validation
- Show specific validation errors to the user before accepting

**FR-023b: String Sanitization on Save**
- Before saving to localStorage, strip HTML tags from all string fields
- Simple implementation: `value.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '')` is sufficient given React's rendering model
- This prevents any future code from accidentally rendering injected HTML

**FR-023c: Type Coercion on Load**
- When reading table data from localStorage, coerce values to expected types
- Numeric fields: `Number(value)` with NaN fallback to 0
- String fields: `String(value).slice(0, 500)` (max 500 chars)
- Boolean fields: explicit true/false check

**FR-023d: No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with Table Data (Architectural Rule)**
- Document as a hard architectural constraint: table field values must NEVER be passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Any future markdown rendering in ship output must use a sanitized renderer (e.g., DOMPurify + marked)

**FR-023e: Content Security Policy (Future)**
- GitHub Pages does not support custom HTTP headers, so CSP cannot be set via headers
- When migrating off GitHub Pages (Netlify/Vercel/self-hosted), add:
  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
  ```
- `unsafe-inline` needed only for Tailwind's inline styles — can be removed with stricter setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Import rejects JSON with invalid schema and shows clear error
- [ ] String fields are stripped of HTML tags before save
- [ ] Numeric fields are coerced with NaN fallback on load
- [ ] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` introduced in any table-data code path

### 11.4 Settings Snapshots (FR-024) — NEW

**Priority:** High
**Added:** March 2, 2026 (Session 4)

**Problem Statement:**
The auto-save model (FR-022a) keeps the user's live working state always current. But users need the ability to name and preserve distinct settings configurations — for example, a "Hard Science" variant, a "Pirate Campaign" variant, and a "Standard CE" baseline. These are named snapshots of the full settings state (all 13 tables + rules) that can be loaded, exported, imported, and deleted.

**Concept:**
Think of it like save slots in a game. The live working state is the active game. Snapshots are save files. You can save at any point, name the save, reload it later, or share it with another player.

---

**FR-024a: Snapshot Storage Structure**

All snapshots stored under a single localStorage key:
```
ce_shipgen_presets  →  Array of Preset objects
```

Preset object schema:
```json
{
  "id": "260302:193045",
  "name": "260302:193045",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-02T19:30:45Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-03-02T19:30:45Z",
  "tables": {
    "ship_hulls": [ ... ],
    "ship_drives": [ ... ],
    "...": "all 13 tables"
  },
  "rules": {
    "ruleSet": "cepheus",
    "bridgeCalculation": "ce_fixed",
    "...": "full RuleSet object"
  }
}
```

**Default name format:** `YYMMDD:HHMMSS` — generated at the moment of save
- Example: `260302:193045` = March 2, 2026 at 19:30:45
- User can rename at any time before or after saving

---

**FR-024b: Save Snapshot**
- Button: "Save Snapshot" in Settings → Data Management
- Default name pre-filled as `YYMMDD:HHMMSS` (editable inline before confirming)
- Captures full current state: all 13 live tables + current rule preferences
- Tables that haven't been customised are captured from `public/data/*.json` defaults at save time, so the snapshot is always a complete, self-contained copy
- If a snapshot with the same name already exists, prompt: "Overwrite existing snapshot '[name]'?"
- Maximum 50 snapshots stored (show warning when approaching limit)

**FR-024c: Snapshots List**
- Display as a card list or table in Settings → Data Management
- Each entry shows:
  - Name (editable inline — click to rename)
  - Created timestamp (human-readable: "Mar 2, 2026 19:30")
  - Active indicator — highlight which snapshot is currently loaded (if any)
- Actions per snapshot:
  - **Load** — replaces live working state with this snapshot's tables and rules
  - **Rename** — inline edit of name field
  - **Export** — downloads this snapshot as a `.json` file
  - **Delete** — removes with confirmation

**FR-024d: Load Snapshot**
- Replaces all `ce_shipgen_live_*` keys and `ce_shipgen_rules` in localStorage with the snapshot's data
- Shows confirmation if live state has unsaved-since-last-snapshot changes (optional, low priority)
- After load, marks that snapshot as "active" in the list
- Toast: "Loaded '[name]'"

**FR-024e: Export Snapshot**
- Downloads the snapshot as a `.json` file
- Filename: `ce-shipgen-[name]-[YYMMDD].json`
  - Example: `ce-shipgen-260302:193045-260302.json`
  - Special characters in name are slugified for filename safety
- File format is the full Preset object (self-contained, importable)

**FR-024f: Import Snapshot**
- Accepts `.json` files in the Preset object format
- Validates schema on import (per FR-023a)
- On success: adds to the snapshots list without automatically loading it
- Prompt: "Snapshot imported as '[name]'. Load it now?"
- If name conflicts with existing snapshot, append ` (imported)` to the name

**FR-024g: Rename Snapshot**
- Click the name in the list to enter inline edit mode
- Press Enter or click away to confirm
- Names must be non-empty, max 80 characters
- Duplicate names are allowed (distinguished by timestamp in metadata)

---

**FR-024h: Relationship to "Reset to Web Defaults" (FR-022b)**
- "Reset to Web Defaults" is still available and still only resets the live working state
- It does NOT delete any snapshots — snapshots are preserved independently
- Suggested workflow: save a snapshot before resetting, so you can restore your work

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] "Save Snapshot" creates entry with default name `YYMMDD:HHMMSS`
- [ ] User can rename snapshot before and after saving
- [ ] Snapshots list shows all saved snapshots with timestamps
- [ ] "Load" replaces live state and marks snapshot as active
- [ ] "Export" downloads valid importable `.json` file
- [ ] "Import" adds snapshot to list without auto-loading
- [ ] "Delete" removes with confirmation
- [ ] Ship library data is never touched by any snapshot operation
- [ ] Snapshots survive page refresh (stored in localStorage)

### 11.5 CI/CD Pipeline — Strategy B (FR-025)

**Priority:** High
**Added:** March 2, 2026 (Session 5)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Problem Statement:**
Every deployment required a manual sequence: `npm install` (which could fail if `tsc` was not on PATH), `npm run build`, constructing a throwaway git repo inside `dist/`, and force-pushing to `gh-pages`. This was fragile, error-prone, and added friction to every milestone. In Session 5 this process broke immediately — `tsc` was not on the system PATH and `npm install` had to be run manually before the build could proceed.

**Root Cause:**
No automated pipeline. Every deploy was a manual 4-step shell process with no gate on build success. The deploy could proceed even if type checking failed.

**Solution: GitHub Actions Workflow**
File: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

**Pipeline stages:**
1. `actions/checkout@v4` — clean checkout of `main`
2. `actions/setup-node@v4` (Node 20, npm cache) — consistent, hermetic environment
3. `npm ci` — reproducible install from `package-lock.json`
4. `npm run build` — runs `tsc && vite build` (type-check is the gate)
5. `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` — pushes `dist/` to `gh-pages` (deploy only on push to `main`, not on PRs)

**PR behavior:** PRs trigger steps 1–4 only (build check, no deploy). Merge to `main` triggers all 5 steps including deploy. This means every PR is validated before it can break the live site.

**Benefits delivered:**
- Zero manual deploy steps after `git push`
- Build failures block deploy — type errors can no longer slip through
- PRs are validated in CI before merge
- Consistent Node environment — no PATH issues across machines
- Commit message from `main` propagated to the `gh-pages` deploy commit for traceability

**Relationship to Optimization Strategies (Session 5 analysis):**
This was identified as the highest-ROI first step from the three-strategy optimization analysis. Strategy A (Playwright E2E) and Strategy C (pre-commit gate) are deferred to later milestones and documented below as upcoming work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Push to `main` automatically triggers build and deploy
- [x] PRs run `npm run build` as a gate — type errors block merge
- [x] Deploy only on push to `main`, not on PRs
- [x] `dist/` pushed to `gh-pages` with commit message traceability
- [x] No manual `npm install` or git operations required for deploy

---

### 11.6 Deferred Optimization Strategies (Future Milestones)

**Added:** March 2, 2026 (Session 5)

These strategies were analyzed and ranked in Session 5. Strategy B (CI/CD) was implemented immediately. Strategies A and C are deferred but documented here to preserve the rationale.

---

**Strategy A — Playwright E2E Tests (Deferred: M3 or M4)**

Automate the manual test plan (currently 10 manual checklist items) with Playwright. Each item maps to a `test()` block. Key capabilities needed:
- `context.setOffline(true)` — simulate offline badge test
- `page.evaluate(() => localStorage.getItem(...))` — verify auto-save persistence
- File download interception — verify snapshot export
- The PWA install prompt test stays manual (`beforeinstallprompt` cannot be reliably simulated in headless browsers)

**Why deferred:** Playwright setup has the highest upfront investment of the three strategies. The manual test plan is manageable at current scale. Playwright becomes critical at M3/M4 when stateful ship design calculations are added — the risk of silent regressions in the calculation engine is where automated E2E tests pay off most.

**Integration point:** Once Strategy B (CI/CD) is stable, add a `test` job to `deploy.yml` that runs `npx playwright test` before the deploy step.

---

**Strategy C — Pre-commit Type + Lint Gate (Deferred: M3)**

Add `husky` + a pre-commit hook running `tsc --noEmit`. The `pwa.d.ts` structural bug in Session 5 (`BeforeInstallPromptEvent` declared outside `declare global {}`) was caught at build time after the fact. A pre-commit hook would catch it at the moment of authorship.

**Why deferred:** With Strategy B in place, the CI build now catches type errors before they reach `gh-pages`. The pre-commit hook adds redundant protection for solo development. It becomes valuable when a second contributor joins or when the codebase grows large enough that `tsc` takes >5 seconds (making CI feedback slow enough to be annoying).

**Implementation:** `husky install` + `.husky/pre-commit` running `npm run build -- --noEmit` (or a dedicated `typecheck` script). Pair with `eslint` for unused-variable enforcement.

### 11.8 M2.6 Blocker — Local Signal & Snapshots Verification Required

**Added:** March 2, 2026 (Session 5 wrap-up)
**Priority:** Critical — must resolve before M3 begins

**Problem Statement:**
End-of-session manual testing revealed that two M2.5 features are not confirmed working in the live deployed app:

1. **FR-021b — Standalone / "Installed" indicator** ("Local signal")
   - The header badge showing "Installed" (green dot) when the app is running as a standalone PWA has not been verified in the live environment
   - The `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')` and `navigator.standalone` detection is implemented in code but has not been tested against the actual installed PWA on a real device or Chrome's install flow
   - Risk: the condition may never be true in practice if the app is not correctly registered as installable, or if the manifest/service worker configuration prevents the standalone display mode from activating

2. **FR-024 — Settings Snapshots**
   - The snapshots component is implemented but has not been verified working end-to-end in the browser
   - Specific concerns: async fetch of default table data during snapshot save, the `key={snapshotVersion}` remount triggering correctly after load, localStorage reads/writes at the `ce_shipgen_presets` key

**Required before M3:**
- [ ] Install the app from https://xunema.github.io/ce-shipgen/ on Chrome desktop
- [ ] Confirm "Installed" badge appears in header when running in standalone mode
- [ ] Confirm badge is absent when running in browser tab
- [ ] Save a snapshot, reload the page, confirm snapshot persists
- [ ] Load a snapshot, re-select a table, confirm data reflects the loaded snapshot
- [ ] If either feature is broken: diagnose, fix, redeploy, re-verify before opening M3

---

**PRD Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT — updated per session
**Last updated:** March 2, 2026 (Session 5 wrap-up)
**Next implementation target:** M2.6 — Verify and fix Local signal (FR-021b) and Snapshots (FR-024) before M3
