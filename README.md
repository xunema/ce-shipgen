## 🛣️ Roadmap & Future Ideas

### Milestone Progress

See [📊 Milestone Status](#-milestone-status) at the top of this document for the full table.

### M2.6: Installed Version Control (Complete ✅)

**Problem solved:** Users with the PWA installed locally had no visibility into which version was running, and updates were applied automatically with no user control.

**What was built:**
- **Version Display** — Current version, channel, and build timestamp shown in Settings → Version section
- **Update Detection** — Service worker monitors for new versions in the background; never forces an update
- **Update Indicators** — Orange dot on Settings icon in header + amber pill on startup screen when update ready
- **User-Controlled Update** — "Update Now" button applies the waiting service worker; user decides when
- **Changelog Viewer** — Expandable changelog in Settings shows what changed before you update
- **Updating Instructions** — Permanent Settings section explains the update model, indicators, data safety, and offline behaviour
- **Offline Guard** — Update button replaced with "Connect to internet to update" when offline
- **Build-time manifest** — `version.json` generated on every `npm run build` via `scripts/write-version.mjs`

**Descoped (not achievable on GitHub Pages):**
- ~~Version rollback~~ — Workbox purges old caches on SW activation; old code cannot be restored without versioned URL hosting
- ~~Release channels (stable/beta)~~ — Requires a multi-channel CI/CD pipeline that does not yet exist

### M2.7: Tables In Play (Current 🎯)

**Problem solved:** The M2 table editor lets users create custom component tables, but there was no way to tell the ship design wizard *which* table to use. Every design step was implicitly hardcoded to built-in defaults.

**What M2.7 adds:**
- **Active Table Registry** — `ce_shipgen_active_tables` in localStorage maps each of the 13 component types to its currently selected table
- **"Tables In Play" view in Settings** — One row per component type, dropdown to switch between CE Default and any custom tables of that type; custom tables highlighted in cyan
- **Reset All to Defaults** — Reverts all selections without touching custom table data
- **`getActiveTable(type)` helper** — Single integration point consumed by M3; no wizard step references a table file directly
- **Snapshot integration** — Active table selections are included in FR-024 settings snapshots

This is the bridge between M2 (edit tables) and M3 (use tables). It enables mixed-rule designs: e.g. standard CE hulls + Mneme drives + custom armor — all selected in one place.

---

### M3: Ship Generation Sub-Milestones

The 19-step ship design process is delivered in three sequential slices:

#### M3.1: Hull & Foundation (⏳ Blocked on M2.7)

**Steps 1–3 + constraint display for 4–6**

- **Hull Selection** — Choose from 18 sizes (100–5000 dtons); auto-calculates HP, SP, hardpoints
- **Configuration** — Standard / Distributed / Close Structure; modifies armor tonnage cost
- **Armor** — Select type and thickness; tonnage = `hull_dtons × armor% × config_multiplier`
- **Drive Constraints** — Once hull is selected, valid letter ranges (A–Z) for M-Drive, J-Drive, and Power Plant are displayed as constraints on steps 4–6 before the user selects them

#### M3.2: Bridge to Crew (⏳ Pending)

**Steps 7–12**

Fuel calculation, Bridge/Cockpit, Computer, Software, Sensors. Crew is **auto-calculated** from component selections — not manually entered — and validated against available bridge stations.

#### M3.3: Fittings to BOQ (⏳ Pending)

**Steps 13–19**

Accommodations, Features, Turrets/Bays/Screens, Weapons, Vehicles, Cargo, and the final **BOQ (Bill of Quantities)** — a complete line-item breakdown of every component with its tonnage and cost. This is the primary output of a completed ship design.

---

### Project Scope & Ecosystem

**CE ShipGen focuses on:** Ships, Habitats, and Vehicles

**Related Projects:**
- **[Mneme World Generator PWA](https://github.com/justinaquino/mneme-world-generator-pwa)** - Handles detailed economic systems including:
  - Trade volume calculations between systems
  - Living economies with dynamic events
  - Market fluctuations and trade route analysis
  - World-building and system generation
  
**This project** (CE ShipGen) provides the vessel construction tools that feed into those economic systems. The Bill of Quantities (BOQ) method used here for ships can scale to vehicles and habitats, but detailed economic simulation remains in the world generator scope.

### Near Term (Milestones 3-4)
- **Ship Library** - Complete save/load/export system with IndexedDB
- **Common Ships** - Pre-built library of standard Cepheus Engine ships
- **Mneme Ships** - Library of ships using Mneme Space Combat rules
- **Stat Cards** - Printable ship reference cards with all combat stats

### Medium Term
- **Markdown/Wikitext Export** - Export ships for blogs, wikis, game materials
  - Format: `[[Ship Name|TL X|Y tons|MCr Z]]` style wiki links
  - Full stat blocks in markdown tables
  - Copy-paste ready for Obsidian, MediaWiki, etc.

- **Advanced Mneme Rules** - Major addition with realistic physics
  - **Mass-based calculations** instead of abstract thrust numbers
  - **Delta-V based calculations** for realistic space travel
  - Educational focus: "What we currently know is possible"
  - Auto-convert common ships to Mneme physics model

- **Habitat Design** - Including MAGICIAN (terrestrial spin habitats)
  - Space station and habitat construction rules
  - Spin gravity calculations
  - Life support and infrastructure

- **Vehicle Construction** (Future Section)
  - The BOQ (Bill of Quantities) method scales to ground vehicles and small craft
  - Grav vehicles, tracked vehicles, wheeled vehicles
  - ATVs, air/rafts, and planetary vehicles
  - Modular component system using same methodology as ships
  - *Note: This extends the ship construction system to smaller craft*
