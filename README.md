## 🎯 Problem Statement

You are a Game Master trying to manage all the ships in your setting and accommodate your players. The amount of time these ships and the complex rules eat up during your prep is overwhelming. You want the freedom to edit and customize ships quickly without getting bogged down in calculations and cross-referencing tables.

**CE ShipGen solves this by:**
- Automating the 19-step Cepheus Engine ship design process
- Providing instant calculations for tonnage, cost, crew, and fuel
- Allowing customization of all ship component data
- Enabling library management for entire fleets
- Working on any device with a modern browser

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Future Ideas

### Near Term (Milestones 3-4)
- **Ship Library** - Complete save/load/export system with IndexedDB
- **Common Ships** - Pre-built library of standard Cepheus Engine ships
- **Mneme Ships** - Library of ships using Mneme Space Combat rules
- **Stat Cards** - Printable ship reference cards with all combat stats

### Medium Term
- **Markdown/Wikitext Export** - Export ships for blogs, wikis, game materials
  - Format: `[[Ship Name|TL X|Y tons|MCr Z]]` style wiki links
  - Full stat blocks in markdown tables
  - Copy-paste ready for Obsidian, MediaWiki, etc.

- **Advanced Mneme Rules** - Major addition with realistic physics
  - **Mass-based calculations** instead of abstract thrust numbers
  - **Delta-V based calculations** for realistic space travel
  - Educational focus: "What we currently know is possible"
  - Auto-convert common ships to Mneme physics model

- **Habitat Design** - Including MAGICIAN (terrestrial spin habitats)
  - Space station and habitat construction rules
  - Spin gravity calculations
  - Life support and infrastructure

### Long Term Vision
- **TL6-TL9 Ship Library** - Low-tech ships transitioning between CE and Mneme tech levels
- **Random Encounter Tables** - Use ship libraries to generate encounter tables
- **Mneme Space Combat Tools** - Fleet creation for Superiority and MAC calculations
  - Opposing fleet generation
  - Superiority modifier calculations
  - Multiple Attack Consolidation (MAC) tools

- **Procedural Ship Layout Design** - Visual ship deck plans
  - 2D web-based deck plan generator (experimental)
  - May pivot to Godot 3D ship builder if web proves limiting
