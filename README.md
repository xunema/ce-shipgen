## 🎯 Problem Statement

You are a Game Master trying to manage all the ships in your setting and accommodate your players. The amount of time these ships and the complex rules eat up during your prep is overwhelming. You want the freedom to edit and customize ships quickly without getting bogged down in calculations and cross-referencing tables.

**CE ShipGen solves this by:**
- Automating the 19-step Cepheus Engine ship design process
- Providing instant calculations for tonnage, cost, crew, and fuel
- Allowing customization of all ship component data
- Enabling library management for entire fleets
- Working on any device with a modern browser

---

## ✨ Features

## 📚 Documentation

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [PRD.md](./PRD.md) | Product Requirements Document — 20 FRs, user stories, technical specs | ✅ Current |
| [PROJECT_NOTES.md](./PROJECT_NOTES.md) | Dev timelog, assumptions, problems, GI7B UI Standard definition | ✅ Current |
| [CE-Chapter-8-Ship-Design-and-Construction.md](./CE-Chapter-8-Ship-Design-and-Construction.md) | Knowledge base — Cepheus Engine SRD Chapter 8 (ship design rules) | ✅ Reference |

> **CE ShipGen is the canonical reference implementation of the [GI7B Generator UI Standard](./PROJECT_NOTES.md#gi7b-generator-ui-standard).** All GI7B generators (CharacterGen, WorldGen) follow the same navigation tree, tile system, and settings structure documented in PROJECT_NOTES.md.

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Future Ideas

### Project Scope & Ecosystem

**CE ShipGen focuses on:** Ships, Habitats, and Vehicles

**Related Projects:**
- **[Mneme World Generator PWA](https://github.com/justinaquino/mneme-world-generator-pwa)** - Handles detailed economic systems including:
  - Trade volume calculations between systems
  - Living economies with dynamic events
  - Market fluctuations and trade route analysis
  - World-building and system generation
  
**This project** (CE ShipGen) provides the vessel construction tools that feed into those economic systems. The Bill of Quantities (BOQ) method used here for ships can scale to vehicles and habitats, but detailed economic simulation remains in the world generator scope.

### Near Term (Milestones 3-4)
- **Ship Library** - Complete save/load/export system with IndexedDB
- **Common Ships** - Pre-built library of standard Cepheus Engine ships
- **Mneme Ships** - Library of ships using Mneme Space Combat rules
- **Stat Cards** - Printable ship reference cards with all combat stats

### Medium Term
- **Markdown/Wikitext Export** - Export ships for blogs, wikis, game materials
  - Format: `[[Ship Name|TL X|Y tons|MCr Z]]` style wiki links
  - Full stat blocks in markdown tables
  - Copy-paste ready for Obsidian, MediaWiki, etc.

- **Advanced Mneme Rules** - Major addition with realistic physics
  - **Mass-based calculations** instead of abstract thrust numbers
  - **Delta-V based calculations** for realistic space travel
  - Educational focus: "What we currently know is possible"
  - Auto-convert common ships to Mneme physics model

- **Habitat Design** - Including MAGICIAN (terrestrial spin habitats)
  - Space station and habitat construction rules
  - Spin gravity calculations
  - Life support and infrastructure

- **Vehicle Construction** (Future Section)
  - The BOQ (Bill of Quantities) method scales to ground vehicles and small craft
  - Grav vehicles, tracked vehicles, wheeled vehicles
  - ATVs, air/rafts, and planetary vehicles
  - Modular component system using same methodology as ships
  - *Note: This extends the ship construction system to smaller craft*

### Logistic Calculators (Major Feature)
Comprehensive supply chain and economic management for ship operations:

- **Supply Calculator** - Recommends supplies for ships and calculates costs
  - Life support requirements (man-days, consumables)
  - Fuel calculations for planned journeys
  - Spare parts and maintenance supplies
  - Cost estimation for resupply

- **Inventory System** - Tracks current balance of inventory over time
  - Real-time resource tracking (fuel, food, air, water)
  - Automated consumption based on crew size and journey duration
  - Low inventory warnings and alerts
  - Multi-ship fleet inventory management

- **Journey Table** - Trip planning from Point A to Point B
  - Row-based journey log (Origin → Destination)
  - Resource consumption calculation per journey
  - Parsecs traveled, time elapsed
  - Fuel costs, life support usage
  - Revenue/passenger income per trip

- **Income Tracker** - Financial management over periods
  - Revenue tracking (passenger fares, freight, mail, charters)
  - Expense tracking (fuel, maintenance, crew salaries, supplies)
  - Profit/loss calculations per journey and per period
  - Cash flow projections
  - Financial reports for ship operations

### Long Term Vision
- **TL6-TL9 Ship Library** - Low-tech ships transitioning between CE and Mneme tech levels
- **Random Encounter Tables** - Use ship libraries to generate encounter tables
- **Mneme Space Combat Tools** - Fleet creation for Superiority and MAC calculations
  - Opposing fleet generation
  - Superiority modifier calculations
  - Multiple Attack Consolidation (MAC) tools

- **Procedural Ship Layout Design** - Visual ship deck plans
  - 2D web-based deck plan generator (experimental)
  - May pivot to Godot 3D ship builder if web proves limiting
